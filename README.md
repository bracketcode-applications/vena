## About
Vena is a concept for a html email intended to be used as an informative newsletter by a consumer-facing health website focusing on the topic of varicose veins and its treatment. 

The code for this template is based on the Cerberus Responsive email code. To learn more about the Cerbrus templates visit the project's website.

All additional customizations were done by [Albert Nera](https://www.technicalmanager.io/) and the code is made available publically for code review and open use under the standard MIT License.

## To Use

1. Download and unzip project files.
2. Open the "vena" html file in a plain text editor or HTML code editor.
3. Modify HTML code to customize colors, fonts and src urls of images* as well as replace placeholder content with your own.
4. Once code has been modified to your liking, you can select all code and copy-paste it to the HTML email editor of the email platform (ex: mailchimp, marketingcloud) you are using.
5. Save changes and if possible, send yourself a test email to verify it renders correctly accross email clients and is fully responsive.

=======================

Footnotes:
- Images need to be hosted by you or uploaded to the digital asset manager (DAM) of the email platform you wish to use. Once uploaded, you will use the direct url to hosted assets as src urls in the email code.
- The images used in the demo are included in the folder labeled "sample assets". Feel free to modify or use these images in your own project.
